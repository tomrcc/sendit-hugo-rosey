      Added: When you send an email campaign, you expect it to reach your
      readers, right? But what if the emails go straight to your subscribers’
      spam folders instead of their inboxes? To make sure your emails reach
      their recipients successfully, follow these email delivery tips. Use an
      ESP Use an email service provider ESP that has been tested by third-party
      email certification services. This ensures that your emails will be
      accepted by the major ISPs. An ESP that offers multiple IP addresses, or
      one that allows you to use your own IP address if necessary. ISPs often
      block messages from unknown senders, so having your own IP address helps
      get around this issue. Be aware of what’s normal for your target
      customers’ inboxes. If you’re sending out emails to people who are on
      Gmail and Yahoo accounts, then there’s little chance they’ll get blocked
      because their addresses haven’t been flagged as spam yet. But if you’re
      reaching out to people with Outlook or AOL addresses, there’s a good
      chance your message will get flagged as junk mail and end up in their spam
      folder before they ever see it. Make sure you’re testing different types
      of addresses before sending out any mass marketing campaigns. Double
      opt-in Before you send out any campaign using an email marketing tool,
      make sure that you have permission from your subscribers to send them
      emails. You can do this by asking them during signup or including a
      checkbox in the subscription form asking if they’d like to receive
      marketing communications from you in the future. Use double opt-in when
      sending out marketing emails. This means that the recipient must have
      previously agreed to receive emails from you before they can see content
      in their inboxes or on their mobile devices. This helps prevent people
      from signing up for newsletters they don’t want and can help protect
      against spam complaints from users who didn’t know they had signed up for
      something in the first place. Keep your content short and sweet. Your
      customers don’t want to read lengthy emails full of text, so keep your
      messages short and sweet. If you have multiple products to promote, break
      up each product offer into its own email instead of sending one page-long
      message with multiple links embedded in it. That way, customers can easily
      find what they’re looking for without having to scroll all over the page.
      Use images sparingly if at all. You might be tempted to include an image
      in every email you send out, but it’s important to remember that images
      can cause problems when it comes to inbox delivery — particularly when
      they’re used incorrectly or included in bulk emails from companies where
      the receiver doesn’t know who sent them. If you’re going Tracking Choose a
      reliable ESP that allows you to track opens and clicks so you can figure
      out which types of messages work best for your audience. Send your best
      email So, remember to keep this in mind and to always know that if you are
      sending out emails related to your business, be sure to follow-up with
      customers or clients and make sure that they are getting their emails in a
      timely manner.

        ### Use an ESP


        Use an email service provider (ESP) that has been tested by third-party

        accepted by the major ISPs. An ESP that offers multiple IP addresses, or
        one that allows you to use your own IP address if necessary. ISPs often
        block messages from unknown senders, so having your own IP address helps
